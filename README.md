# Leah's GRC & Cybersecurity Portfolio

👋 Hi there! I’m Leah, a Cybersecurity Management & Policy student at the University of Maryland Global Campus (UMGC). 
I created this repository to document my journey into cybersecurity, with a special focus on governance, risk, and compliance (GRC).

This portfolio highlights my progress, projects, study materials, and learning reflections as I work toward a career in IT auditing, risk analysis, and compliance.

## 🚀 Current Goals

- ✅ Study for **CompTIA Security+** (Exam target: April/May 2025)
- 📘 Begin preparing for **CISA** (Certified Information Systems Auditor)
- 📚 Deepen my understanding of NIST SP 800-53, ISO 27001, and other frameworks
- 🛠️ Gain hands-on experience with security policies, risk assessments, and compliance strategies
