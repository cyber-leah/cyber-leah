# Leah's GRC & Cybersecurity Portfolio

👋 Hi there! I’m Leah, a Cybersecurity Management & Policy student at the University of Maryland Global Campus (UMGC). 
I created this repository to document my journey into cybersecurity, with a special focus on governance, risk, and compliance (GRC).

This portfolio highlights my progress, projects, study materials, and learning reflections as I work toward a career in IT auditing, risk analysis, and compliance.
